## Vision to Open Source : 
We have to add more features into this repo - 

### 1. Create a User Authentication System:
- Implement user authentication using a library like Firebase Authentication, Auth0, or your custom backend.
- Create registration, login, and logout functionality.
- Ensure that user-specific data and tasks are properly isolated.

### 2. Database Integration:
- Set up a database to store user data and tasks. Popular choices include Firebase Realtime Database, Firestore, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL.
- Create database schemas for users and tasks.

### 3. Redux Setup:
- Create Redux slices for managing user authentication and todo tasks.
- Implement actions and reducers to handle user authentication and todo CRUD operations.
- Set up Redux store configuration and middleware.

### 4. UI Components:
- Design and create UI components for your todo list application using React components and styles.
- Implement features like adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.
- Create user-friendly forms for adding and editing tasks.

### 5. User Dashboard:
- Build a user dashboard where users can view their tasks.
- Display user-specific tasks using Redux state.
- Add features like filtering tasks (e.g., completed, in-progress, overdue) and sorting.

### 6. Real-time Updates:
- Implement real-time updates using WebSocket or Firebase Realtime Database to sync tasks across multiple users in real-time.
- Ensure that when one user makes a change, it reflects immediately for other users.

### 7. Error Handling and Validation:
- Implement error handling for user authentication and database operations.
- Validate user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities and data corruption.

### 8. Testing:
- Write unit tests and integration tests for your components and Redux reducers/actions.
- Ensure proper test coverage to catch bugs early in development.

### 9. Deployment:
- Deploy your application to a hosting service like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify.
- Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

### 10. Security:
- Implement security best practices to protect user data and prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).
- Secure your API endpoints and user authentication mechanisms.

### 11. Documentation and Maintenance:
- Document your codebase, including how to set up and run the project.
- Plan for ongoing maintenance, including updates to dependencies and bug fixes.


## Features : 
- Creating a multi-user todo list application with all features requires careful planning and implementation. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the features you'd want to include:

### 1. User Authentication:
- User registration with email/password or social login (Google, Facebook, etc.).
- User login with proper authentication flow.
- User profile management (e.g., change password, profile picture).

### 2. User Dashboard:
- Each user should have their own dashboard displaying their tasks.
- Display user-specific tasks using Redux or database queries.
- Implement features like filtering (completed, in-progress, overdue) and sorting tasks.

### 3. Task Management:
- Create, read, update, and delete tasks (CRUD operations).
- Set due dates and reminders for tasks.
- Assign tasks to specific users or collaborators.
- Categorize tasks (e.g., personal, work, shopping).
- Add labels or tags to tasks for better organization.
- Prioritize tasks (e.g., high, medium, low priority).
- Add attachments or links to tasks.
- Add comments or notes to tasks for additional context.

### 4. Real-time Collaboration:
- Implement real-time updates using WebSocket or Firebase Realtime Database.
- Users should see changes made by other collaborators in real-time.
- Collaborators can leave comments or notes on shared tasks.

### 5. Sharing and Permissions:
- Allow users to share tasks or task lists with other users.
- Define permissions for shared tasks (read-only, edit).
- Implement access controls to ensure data privacy and security.

### 6. Notifications:
- Send notifications or reminders to users for upcoming tasks.
- Implement push notifications for mobile or desktop.
- Users can customize notification preferences.

### 7. Task Status and Progress:
- Users can mark tasks as completed or in-progress.
- Calculate task completion percentages and show progress.
- Archive completed tasks or move them to a separate section.

### 8. Search and Filter:
- Implement a search feature to find specific tasks.
- Allow users to filter tasks based on various criteria (e.g., date, category, label).

### 9. Mobile Responsiveness:
- Ensure your application is responsive and works well on mobile devices.

### 10. Data Synchronization:
- Implement data synchronization to ensure data consistency across devices for the same user.

### 11. Security:
- Implement security best practices to protect user data and prevent common vulnerabilities.
- Secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Secure API endpoints and database access.


## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
